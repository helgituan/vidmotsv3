3.Who are team members you should consider hiring to build your ARCore experience?
3D artists
 False
5.When considering UX/UI, one good rule of thumb to remember with AR is:
Avoid cluttering the screen with too many buttons or elements that might be confusing to users
6.It is a good idea to use as many photorealistic assets in your AR project as possible.
False
7.What might break immersion in an AR app?
Assets that attempt photorealism and disappoint
Peering inside 3D digital objects
Insufficient surface mapping data making objects float in air
X - All of the above
8.To create your own AR project it is imperative to learn 3D modelling tools like Maya, ZBrush, and 3ds max.
False
9.When it comes to UX and UI:
VITLAUST!!!

Basic interaction options

Module 4 practice quiz
1.ARCore is able to detect some surfaces even in low light conditions.
True
2.What is pose?
The position and orientation of any object in relation to the world around it
3.Spatial mapping...
Creates a 3D map of the environment
4.When you have “placed” a virtual object and it remains at that point, this means it is:
Anchored
5.ARCore constantly learns from the environment as the phone moves around the world.
Yes
